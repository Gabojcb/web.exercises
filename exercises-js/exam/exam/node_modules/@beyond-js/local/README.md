# Welcome to @beyond-js/local

This package is used for two main functions:

1. Listening for changes from the BeyondJS Inspector and performing immediate loading via HMR of modified elements.
2. Checking the status of the launchers and turning them on prior to the execution of the action.

The package enables HMR behavior in projects made with BeyondJS and is a required dependency for the development environment.
